# AirBnB_clone v1 - File storage / Console

The purpose of this project is to recreate the AirBnB site, from the back-end data management to the front-end user interface.

This repo contains the first part of the project which consists in :

*    put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
*    create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
*    create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
*    create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage
*    create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

# Command interpreter

We have created a command line that allows us to manage objects that store data.

### Mandatory part

The console supports the following commands :

*   Create an object of the class name:

        (hbnb) create class_name

*   Display object information if it exists:

    (hbnb) show class_name id

*   Delete the object if its exists:

    (hbnb) destroy class_name id

*   Display all instances, or only instances of the specified objects:

    (hbnb) all / (hbnb) all class_name

*   Update an instance attribute of a previously declared object:

    (hbnb) update class_name id attribute_name attribute_value

### Advanced part

Additionally, you can use the following command formats :

*   Display the number of instances of the specified class:

    (hbnb) class_name.count()

*   Display object information if it exists:

    (hbnb) class_name.show(id)

*   Delete the object if its exists:

    (hbnb) class_name.destroy(id)

*   Display all instances of the specified objects:

    (hbnb) class_name.all()

## Installation
