# AirBnB_clone v1 - File storage / Console

The purpose of this project is to recreate the AirBnB site, from the back-end data management to the front-end user interface.

This repo contains the first part of the project which consists in :

*    put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
*    create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
*    create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
*    create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage
*    create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
